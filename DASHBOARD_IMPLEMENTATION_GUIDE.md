## 💡 Implementation Tips

### For Curriculum Tab

```typescript
// Example structure for curriculum materials
interface Material {
  type: 'file' | 'link' | 'image' | 'pdf';
  url: string;
  name: string;
}

// When saving:
const curriculum = {
  wp1_type: 'pdf',
  wp1_url: 'https://...',
  wp1_name: 'Warm Up Activity 1',
  // ...repeat for wp2-wp4, ma1-ma5, a1-a4, hw1-hw6, p1-p4
};
```

### For Student Homework Cards

```typescript
// Mark homework as complete
const markComplete = async (homeworkItem: string) => {
  await supabase.from('homework_completion').insert({
    student_id: user.id,
    curriculum_id: curriculumId,
    homework_item: homeworkItem, // 'hw1', 'hw2', etc.
    completed: true,
    completed_date: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};
```

### For Stats Dashboard

```typescript
// Get skills by category
const { data: speakingSkills } = await supabase
  .from('skills_evaluation')
  .select('*')
  .eq('student_id', studentId)
  .eq('skill_category', 'Speaking');

// Calculate average
const avgScore = speakingSkills.reduce((sum, skill) =>
  sum + (skill.average_score || 0), 0) / speakingSkills.length;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't log in?
- Check database schema is loaded
- Verify demo data is inserted
- Check browser console for errors

### Components not rendering?
- Check imports in TeacherDashboard.tsx
- Ensure all tab components export default

### Supabase errors?
- Verify RLS policies are created
- Check table names match exactly
- Confirm .env has correct credentials

## 📚 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Create remaining teacher tab components (Curriculum, Students, Assessment, Skills, Blog)
2. Build complete student dashboard with homework tracking
3. Implement stats visualization with charts (use recharts library)
4. Add file upload functionality (use Supabase Storage)
5. Add admin role and dashboard
6. Implement real authentication (instead of simple password check)
