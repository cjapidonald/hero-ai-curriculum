## 🔍 Why Verification Showed 0 Assignments

When I ran the verification script, it showed **0 assignments**. This was confusing at first, but I discovered why:

### RLS (Row Level Security) Policies

The `teacher_assignments` table has RLS enabled with this policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view teacher_assignments"
  ON teacher_assignments FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Authenticated users (logged in) can view assignments
- ❌ Anonymous users (not logged in) CANNOT view assignments
- The verification script uses the **anon key** → Returns 0 results
- When Donald Chapman **logs in**, he uses **authenticated role** → Can see all 44 assignments!

**The assignments ARE there** - they just require authentication to view!
