# ✅ Teacher Dashboard Updated

## 🎉 Changes Made

I've updated the Teacher Dashboard based on your requirements:

---

## ✅ What Was Done:

### 1. **Removed Curriculum Tab** ❌
   - Removed from tabs list
   - Removed from validTabs array
   - Removed from switch case
   - Removed imports (CurriculumDashboard, Layers icon)
   - **Reason:** You said it doesn't work

### 2. **Replaced Lesson Builder with Admin's Curriculum Panel** ✅
   - **Before:** Used `LessonBuilder.tsx` (teacher-specific)
   - **After:** Now uses `CurriculumManagementPanel` (admin component)
   - **Result:** Teacher dashboard now has the SAME lesson builder as admin view
