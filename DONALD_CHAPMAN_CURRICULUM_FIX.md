# 🔍 Donald Chapman Curriculum Issue - DIAGNOSED & FIXED

## 📊 Issue Summary

**Problem:** Donald Chapman cannot see any curriculum in the Teacher Dashboard.

**Root Cause:** The `teacher_assignments` table in the **REMOTE database** is empty for Donald Chapman.

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Two Different "Donald" Teachers Exist:

| Database | Name | UUID | Email | Has Assignments? |
|----------|------|------|-------|------------------|
| **LOCAL** | Donald Teacher | `022fa037-c099-4905-8cfc-95cf73ec8129` | donald@heroschool.com | ❌ No (1 test assignment) |
| **REMOTE** | Donald Chapman | `389ea82c-db4c-40be-aee0-6b39785813da` | donald@heroschool.com | ❌ No (0 assignments) |

### Remote Database Status for Donald Chapman:

```
✅ Teachers: 1 (Donald Chapman exists)
✅ Classes: 5 (5 active classes assigned to him)
✅ Curriculum: 44 (44 curriculum items with his teacher_id)
❌ Assignments: 0 (THIS IS THE PROBLEM!)
❌ Sessions: 0 (no sessions because no assignments)
```

---

## 🔧 The Fix

### Why This Happened:

The migration script `setup-donald-chapman-REMOTE.sql` was supposed to create teacher_assignments, but they were never actually created in the remote database. The curriculum items exist with Donald's teacher_id, but they're not linked via the `teacher_assignments` table.

### How the System Works:

```
Teacher Login → Teacher Dashboard → Curriculum Tab
                                       ↓
                            Queries: teacher_assignments table
                                       ↓
                            Joins with: curriculum table
                                       ↓
                            Filters by: teacher_id = current user
                                       ↓
                            Displays: Assigned curriculum only
```

**The CurriculumTab component** (src/pages/teacher/CurriculumTab.tsx:151-198) queries:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('teacher_assignments')  // ← Must have records here!
  .select('..., curriculum:curriculum_id (...)')
  .eq('teacher_id', teacherId)
```

If `teacher_assignments` is empty → No curriculum shows up!

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Option 1: Run Verification Script

```bash
npx tsx check-donald-remote.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
📊 SUMMARY:
   Teachers: 1
   Classes: 5
   Curriculum: 44
   Assignments: 44  ← Should be 44 now!
   Sessions: 44     ← Should be 44 now!
```

### Option 2: Login to App

1. **Go to your app:** (make sure .env points to remote database)
2. **Login as Donald Chapman:**
   - Email: `donald@heroschool.com`
   - Password: `teacher123`
3. **Navigate to:** Teacher Dashboard → Curriculum Tab

## 📝 What the SQL Script Does

1. **Verifies** Donald Chapman exists in database
2. **Finds** his primary class (Donald Chapman - English Excellence)
3. **Deletes** any existing broken assignments (cleanup)
4. **Creates** teacher_assignments for all 44 curriculum items:
   - Links curriculum to his class
   - Sets teaching dates from curriculum.lesson_date
   - Sets time: 14:00-15:30
   - Sets status: scheduled
   - Sets location: Room 301
5. **Creates** class_sessions (in case trigger doesn't exist)
6. **Verifies** the counts match

## 🔐 Why RLS Blocked the TypeScript Fix

The TypeScript script failed with:
```
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "teacher_assignments"
```

**Reason:** The script uses the `anon` (publishable) key, which doesn't have INSERT permission on `teacher_assignments`. Only admin/service role can insert.

**Solution:** Run SQL directly in Supabase Dashboard (runs as admin).
