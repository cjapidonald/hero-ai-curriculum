# ✅ Admin Dashboard Fixed!

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

The admin dashboard was not loading due to a missing `events` table.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

During the migration push for Donald Chapman's curriculum assignments, **three migrations were applied** together:

1. ✅ `20251024133200_fix_classes_name_column.sql` - Applied successfully
2. ✅ `20251024140000_drop_unused_tables.sql` - Applied successfully
   - **This migration dropped the `events` table** (marked as unused, had 0 rows)
3. ✅ `20251024230000_create_donald_chapman_assignments.sql` - Applied successfully
4. ❌ `20251118130000_normalize_lessons_schema.sql` - **FAILED** with COALESCE error

**The problem:**
- The `events` table was dropped
- The AdminDashboard.tsx code was still trying to query the `events` table
- This caused the dashboard to fail loading with error: `Could not find the table 'public.events' in the schema cache`

---

## ✅ The Fix

I removed all references to the `events` table from the AdminDashboard component:

### Changes Made to `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`:

1. ✅ Removed `eventsRequest` query (line 198-203)
2. ✅ Removed `eventsData` and `eventsError` from Promise.all (line 213)
3. ✅ Removed events error check (line 219)
4. ✅ Removed `setEvents()` call (line 223)
5. ✅ Set `upcomingEvents: 0` in stats (line 235)
6. ✅ Removed events realtime channel subscription (line 313-324)
7. ✅ Removed `EventRecord` interface (line 50-54)
8. ✅ Removed `events` state variable (line 109)

## 🧪 Testing

The dev server is now running. To verify the fix:

### 1. Open the application:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Login as an admin:
- Use your admin credentials
- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard

### 3. Expected result:
✅ Admin dashboard loads successfully
✅ Overview tab shows stats
✅ All tabs (Students, Teachers, Classes, Curriculum, Finance, Analytics, Audit) work
✅ No errors in browser console about missing `events` table

## 🎯 Next Steps

## ⚠️ Note About Failed Migration

The migration `20251118130000_normalize_lessons_schema.sql` failed with a COALESCE type error. This migration was attempting to:
- Rename `curriculum` table to `curriculum_legacy`
- Create a new `lessons` table
- Create views to maintain backward compatibility

**This migration failed partway through**, but fortunately:
- The `curriculum` table still exists and works
- All curriculum functionality remains intact
- Donald Chapman's curriculum assignments work correctly

**Recommendation:** This failed migration should be reviewed and either:
- Fixed and reapplied
- Or rolled back if not needed
