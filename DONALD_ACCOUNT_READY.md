## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "No sessions found" in Curriculum tab

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor or psql:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM class_sessions
WHERE teacher_id = '22b11e4b-a242-4fc3-bdbe-a6dab4aea948';
```

- **Expected:** Should return `8`
- **If 0:** Sessions weren't created. Re-run the setup script.
- **If 8 but still not showing:** Check RLS policies or auth.uid() mismatch

---

### Problem: Can't login / Invalid credentials

**Solutions:**
1. **Password case-sensitive:** Make sure it's exactly `password123`
2. **Email correct:** `donald@heroschool.com`
3. **Reset password if needed:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE auth.users
   SET encrypted_password = crypt('newpassword', gen_salt('bf'))
   WHERE email = 'donald@heroschool.com';
   ```

---

### Problem: Lessons appear but can't click buttons

**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Teacher ID matches auth user ID:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     (SELECT id FROM teachers WHERE email = 'donald@heroschool.com') as teacher_id,
     (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'donald@heroschool.com') as auth_id;
   ```
   - **Expected:** Both IDs should be `22b11e4b-a242-4fc3-bdbe-a6dab4aea948`

---

### Problem: Classes don't show students

**This is normal!** No students have been assigned to Donald's classes yet.

**To add students:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Students section
3. Create/edit a student
4. Assign to one of Donald's classes

---

## üìä DATABASE VERIFICATION

To verify Donald's setup in the database, run these queries:

```sql
-- Check Donald's sessions
SELECT
  cs.session_date,
  c.class_name,
  cur.lesson_title,
  cs.status
FROM class_sessions cs
LEFT JOIN classes c ON c.id = cs.class_id
LEFT JOIN curriculum cur ON cur.id = cs.curriculum_id
WHERE cs.teacher_id = '22b11e4b-a242-4fc3-bdbe-a6dab4aea948'
ORDER BY cs.session_date;

-- Should return 8 rows

-- Check auth user exists
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'donald@heroschool.com';

-- Should return 1 row

-- Check RLS policies allow teacher to see sessions
SELECT tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'class_sessions'
  AND policyname LIKE '%teacher%';

-- Should show policy allowing teachers to view their own sessions
```
