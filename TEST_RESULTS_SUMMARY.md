## üß™ NEXT STEPS - TESTING

### **Step 1: Verify in Database** (5 minutes)

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run the queries from:
üìÅ `verify-teacher-curriculum-sync.sql`

**Expected Results:**
- Query 1: Should show at least 1 teacher with sessions
- Query 2: Should show 6+ total class sessions
- Query 3: Should list teachers with their session counts
- Query 4: Should show Donald's specific sessions (if Donald exists)
- Query 5: Should return 0 rows (means perfect sync!)
- Query 6: Should show teachers with classes assigned
- Query 7: Should show 2 triggers (sync + deletion)
- Query 8: Should list all active teacher UUIDs

---

### **Step 2: Test Teacher Login** (10 minutes)

#### **Option A: Test with Donald's Account**

1. **Get Donald's credentials:**
   - Email: Check database for Donald's email
   - Password: (you should know this or reset it)

     - ‚úÖ Average attendance
     - ‚úÖ "Take Attendance" button

#### **Option B: Test with Any Active Teacher**

     - Curriculum: (select a lesson)
     - Teaching Date: Tomorrow's date
     - Start Time: 09:00
     - End Time: 10:30
     - Status: Scheduled
   - **Save**

3. **Verify Trigger Works:**
   - Run this query in SQL Editor:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM class_sessions
     WHERE session_date = CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 day'
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT 1;
     ```
   - **Expected:** You should see the new session created automatically!

4. **Verify Teacher Sees It:**

## üéØ WHAT WAS FIXED

### **The Problem:**
```
BEFORE:
Admin creates assignment
    ‚Üì
teacher_assignments table (stored here)
    ‚Üì
Teacher queries class_sessions table (EMPTY!)
    ‚Üì
Teacher sees: "No sessions found" ‚ùå
```

### **The Solution:**
```
AFTER:
Admin creates assignment
    ‚Üì
teacher_assignments table (stored here)
    ‚Üì
Trigger fires automatically ‚ö°
    ‚Üì
class_sessions table (record created!)
    ‚Üì
Teacher queries class_sessions table (HAS DATA!)
    ‚Üì
Teacher sees: Full curriculum list ‚úÖ
```

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If teachers still see "No sessions found":**

1. **Check if trigger is enabled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT tgname, tgenabled
   FROM pg_trigger
   WHERE tgname = 'trigger_sync_assignment_to_session';
   ```
   - Expected: `tgenabled = 'O'` (origin trigger, enabled)

2. **Check if data was synced:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM class_sessions;
   ```
   - Expected: Should be > 0

3. **Check teacher_id matches:**
   ```sql
   -- Get logged-in teacher's UUID from browser console:
   -- supabase.auth.getUser()

   SELECT * FROM class_sessions
   WHERE teacher_id = '<teacher-uuid>';
   ```

4. **Check RLS policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'class_sessions';
   ```
   - Should see policy: "Teachers can view their own class sessions"
