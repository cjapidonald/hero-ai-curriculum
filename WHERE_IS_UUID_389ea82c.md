## üîç DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Check What's in Your Browser Console:

1. **Open your app:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Press F12** to open DevTools
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Type this:**
   ```javascript
   supabase.auth.getUser().then(r => console.log('Current User:', r.data.user))
   ```
5. **What UUID do you see?**

---

### Check If You're Logged In:

1. **Open browser console (F12)**
2. **Type:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')
   ```
3. **Do you see a token?** If yes, you might be logged in as someone

4. **Clear auth and try again:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   // Then refresh page and login again
   ```

### Check Which Database You're Looking At:

**Local Database:**
- URL: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres`
- Only has 1 Donald: `22b11e4b-a242-4fc3-bdbe-a6dab4aea948`

**Remote Database (if you have one):**
- URL: Check your Supabase dashboard
- Might have different data!

## üéØ CURRENT STATE

### Local Database (What I Just Set Up):

**Only ONE Donald exists:**
- UUID: `22b11e4b-a242-4fc3-bdbe-a6dab4aea948`
- Email: `donald@heroschool.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Has: 8 curriculum sessions, 4 classes

**The UUID 389ea82c does NOT exist anywhere:**
- ‚ùå Not in teachers table
- ‚ùå Not in auth.users table
- ‚ùå Not in any table

---

## üîß POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:

### 1. **You're Looking at Remote Database**
If you have a remote Supabase project, it might have different data.

**Check:**
- Open Supabase Dashboard (cloud)
- Go to Table Editor ‚Üí teachers
- Search for Donald
- See what UUIDs exist there

### 2. **Stale Frontend Cache**
The frontend might have old data cached.

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)

### 3. **Wrong Environment Variable**
Your .env file might be pointing to remote instead of local.

**Check:**
```bash
cat .env | grep SUPABASE
```

Should show:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<local-key>
```

### 4. **Multiple Browser Tabs**
You might have one tab on local, another on remote.

**Check:**
- Close all tabs
- Open only one tab
- Check the URL in address bar
