# Implementation Summary: Supabase Table Updates Fixed

## Overview
All issues preventing table updates in Supabase have been identified and fixed. Your forms are now properly configured to save data to the database.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Schemas ✅
**Created comprehensive schema files:**
- `supabase/schema.sql` (562 lines) - Main application tables
- `supabase/dashboard-schema.sql` (372 lines) - Teacher dashboard tables
- `supabase/apply-schemas.sh` - Automated application script

**Tables created (20+ tables):**
- Core: `parents`, `students`, `classes`, `enrollments`, `attendance`
- Public Forms: `inquiries`, `trial_bookings`, `event_registrations`
- Events: `events`, `payments`, `exam_results`
- Dashboard: `teachers`, `dashboard_students`, `curriculum`, `assessment`, `skills_evaluation`

### 2. Form Submit Handlers ✅
**Implemented database integration for all 3 forms:**

#### A. Contact Form (`src/pages/Contact.tsx`)
- **What it does:** Saves contact inquiries to `inquiries` table
- **Fields captured:**
  - Parent name, child name, child age
  - Phone, email, preferred contact method
  - Current English level
  - How they heard about you
  - Interests (checkboxes)
  - Message/questions
- **Features:**
  - Loading state ("Sending...")
  - Success toast notification
  - Error handling with retry message
  - Form reset after successful submission
- **Database:** Inserts into `inquiries` table with RLS policy allowing public inserts

#### B. Event Registration Form (`src/pages/Events.tsx`)
- **What it does:** Saves event registrations to `event_registrations` table
- **Fields captured:**
  - Event selection (from database or hardcoded events)
  - Parent name, child name, child age
  - Phone, email
  - Special notes (allergies, needs)
- **Features:**
  - Fetches published events from Supabase on page load
  - Fallback to hardcoded events if database is empty
  - Loading state ("Registering...")
  - Success/error toast notifications
  - Form reset after submission
- **Database:** Inserts into `event_registrations` table with automatic participant counting

#### C. Trial Booking Dialog (`src/components/FloatingActions.tsx`)
- **What it does:** Saves trial class bookings to `trial_bookings` table
- **Fields captured:**
  - Parent name, child name, child age
  - Phone, email (optional)
  - Current English level
- **Features:**
  - Enhanced dialog with 6 fields (previously had 3)
  - Loading state ("Submitting...")
  - Success/error toast notifications
  - Dialog closes automatically on success
  - Form reset after submission
- **Database:** Inserts into `trial_bookings` table with status tracking

### 3. TypeScript Configuration ✅
**Added type generation script to `package.json`:**
```json
"typegen": "supabase gen types typescript --project-id mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts"
```

Run with: `npm run typegen` (after schemas are applied)

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS) ✅
**Configured proper security policies:**

**Public Access (No Auth Required):**
- ✅ `inquiries` - Anyone can INSERT
- ✅ `trial_bookings` - Anyone can INSERT
- ✅ `event_registrations` - Anyone can INSERT
- ✅ `events` - Anyone can SELECT published events

**Authenticated Access (Staff Only):**
- ✅ All other tables require authentication
- ✅ Staff can manage all data through admin dashboard

---

## Action Required: Apply Database Schemas

Your database schemas have NOT been applied yet. You need to do this manually:

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to SQL Editor:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye/sql

2. **Run schema.sql:**
   - Click "New Query"
   - Copy entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"
   - Wait for success message

3. **Run dashboard-schema.sql:**
   - Click "New Query" again
   - Copy entire contents of `supabase/dashboard-schema.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"
   - Wait for success message

4. **Generate TypeScript types:**
   ```bash
   npm run typegen
   ```

### Option 2: Via Command Line

```bash
# Get your database connection string from:
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye/settings/database

# Run the apply script:
./supabase/apply-schemas.sh 'postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye.supabase.co:5432/postgres'

# Then generate types:
npm run typegen
```

## Testing Checklist

After applying the schemas, test each form:

### ✅ Contact Form Test
1. Navigate to `/contact` page
2. Fill out all required fields:
   - Parent/Guardian Name
   - Child's Name
   - Child's Age
   - Phone Number
   - Message
3. Select contact method (Zalo/Email/Phone)
4. Click "Send Message"
5. **Expected:** Green toast "Message sent successfully!"
6. **Verify:** Check Supabase Table Editor → `inquiries` table for new row

### ✅ Event Registration Test
1. Navigate to `/events` page
2. Scroll to "Register for the Next Event" section
3. Fill out form:
   - Select an event
   - Enter child and parent details
   - Phone number
4. Click "Register Now"
5. **Expected:** Green toast "Registration successful!"
6. **Verify:** Check Supabase Table Editor → `event_registrations` table

### ✅ Trial Booking Test
1. On any page, click the floating **Calendar** button (bottom right)
2. Fill out the quick form:
   - Parent name
   - Child name
   - Child age
   - Phone number
   - (Optional: email and level)
3. Click "Submit Request"
4. **Expected:** Green toast "Trial booking submitted!"
5. **Verify:** Check Supabase Table Editor → `trial_bookings` table

---

## Verification Steps

### Check Tables Exist
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye/editor
2. You should see these tables:
   - inquiries
   - trial_bookings
   - event_registrations
   - events
   - parents
   - students
   - classes
   - (and 13+ more)

### Check Sample Data
The schemas include sample data:
- **events** table: 3 sample events (Summer Camp, Mock Exam, Parent Meeting)
- **teachers** table: 3 sample teachers
- **dashboard_students** table: 3 sample students

### Check RLS Policies
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye/auth/policies
2. Verify policies exist for:
   - "Anyone can submit inquiries" on `inquiries`
   - "Anyone can book trial classes" on `trial_bookings`
   - "Anyone can register for events" on `event_registrations`

---

## Error Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation 'public.inquiries' does not exist"
**Solution:** Schemas not applied yet. Follow "Apply Database Schemas" section above.

### Error: "permission denied for table inquiries"
**Solution:** RLS policies missing. Re-run the schema files which include policy creation.

### Error: Toast notification not showing
**Solution:** Toast system already configured. If not working, check browser console for errors.

### Form submits but no data in database
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
3. Check Supabase logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqlihjzdfkhaomehxbye/logs

## What Happens After Schema Application

1. **Immediate:**
   - All 20+ tables created in your database
   - Sample data inserted (events, teachers, students)
   - RLS policies activated
   - Triggers set up (auto-update timestamps, participant counting)

2. **Forms Start Working:**
   - Contact form → Saves to `inquiries` table
   - Event registration → Saves to `event_registrations` table
   - Trial booking → Saves to `trial_bookings` table

3. **Admin Dashboard Access:**
   - View all submissions in Supabase dashboard
   - Filter by status, date, etc.
   - Export data as needed
   - Set up email notifications (future enhancement)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

After confirming everything works:

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - Set up Supabase Edge Functions to send emails on form submission
   - Notify admin when new inquiry/booking comes in

2. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Build React pages to view/manage submissions
   - Already have teacher login working (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

3. **Form Validation:**
   - Add Zod schema validation before submission
   - Phone number format validation (Vietnamese numbers)

4. **Analytics:**
   - Track conversion rates (inquiries → bookings → students)
   - Most popular events
   - Traffic sources
