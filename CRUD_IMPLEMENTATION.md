# Full-Stack CRUD Implementation with Real-Time Sync

This document describes the comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system implemented across the HeroSchool application, connecting the frontend with Supabase backend and providing real-time synchronization across all user dashboards.

## Overview

The implementation provides:
- **Real-time synchronization** - Changes made by any user (admin, teacher, student) are instantly reflected across all connected dashboards
- **Role-based permissions** - Admins have full access, teachers can manage their own data, students have read-only access
- **Comprehensive UI** - Edit, save, add, and delete buttons for all major entities
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support with Supabase-generated types

## Architecture

### 1. Real-Time Hooks (`/src/hooks/`)

#### Core Hook: `useRealtimeTable.ts`
A generic hook that provides:
- Automatic real-time subscriptions to Supabase tables
- CRUD operations (create, update, delete, refresh)
- Loading and error states
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { data, loading, create, update, remove, refresh } = useRealtimeTable<Student>(
  'dashboard_students',
  '*',
  [{ column: 'class', value: 'Starters A' }]
);
```

#### Simplified Hook: `useCRUD.ts`
For non-realtime operations with toast notifications:
```typescript
const { create, update, remove, loading } = useCRUD<Student>('dashboard_students');
```

#### Specialized Hooks:
- `useStudents.ts` - Student management
- `useTeachers.ts` - Teacher management
- `useCurriculum.ts` - Curriculum/lessons management
- `useAssessments.ts` - Assessment management
- `useAssignments.ts` - Assignment management
- `useCalendarSessions.ts` - Calendar/scheduling management

### 2. CRUD Components (`/src/components/crud/`)

All CRUD components follow a consistent pattern:

#### `StudentCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Full table view with pagination support
- Add student dialog with comprehensive form
- Edit student (inline or dialog-based)
- Delete student with confirmation
- Role-based action buttons (admins and teachers can edit)
- Real-time updates across all dashboards

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  classFilter?: string;      // Filter students by class
  showActions?: boolean;     // Show/hide action buttons (default: true)
}
```

#### `TeacherCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Admin-only access
- Add/edit/delete teachers
- Manage teacher profiles and subjects
- Real-time synchronization

#### `CurriculumCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Create and manage lessons
- Add warmup, main, assessment, and homework activities
- Attach resources (PDFs, links, images, files)
- Filter by teacher
- Edit lesson dates and schedules
- Real-time sync when teachers or admins make changes

#### `CalendarSessionCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Schedule class sessions
- Set start/end times
- Mark session status (scheduled, completed, cancelled)
- Track attendance
- Real-time updates when sessions are scheduled or modified

#### `AssignmentCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Create assignments for entire classes or individual students
- Set due dates
- Assignment types (homework, assessment, printable, custom)
- Real-time delivery to student dashboards

#### `AssessmentCRUD.tsx`
**Features:**
- Create rubric-based assessments
- 5 rubric criteria with scores (0-5)
- Automatic total score calculation
- Publish/unpublish to students
- Feedback field
- Real-time score updates visible to students when published

### 3. Dashboard Integration

#### Admin Dashboard (`/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`)

**New Tabs Added:**
- **Students** - Full CRUD with `<StudentCRUD />`
- **Teachers** - Full CRUD with `<TeacherCRUD />`
- **Curriculum** - Full CRUD with `<CurriculumCRUD />`
- **Calendar** - Session management with `<CalendarSessionCRUD />`
- **Assignments** - Full CRUD with `<AssignmentCRUD />`
- **Assessments** - Full CRUD with `<AssessmentCRUD />`

**Permissions:** Admins have full create, read, update, and delete access to all tables.

#### Teacher Dashboard (`/src/pages/teacher/TeacherDashboard.tsx`)

**Updated Tabs:**
- **Calendar** - Manage class sessions with `<CalendarSessionCRUD teacherId={user.id} />`
- **Curriculum** - Manage lessons with `<CurriculumCRUD teacherId={user.id} />`
- **Students** - View/edit students with `<StudentCRUD />`
- **Assignments** - Create assignments with `<AssignmentCRUD teacherId={user.id} />`
- **Assessment** - Create assessments with `<AssessmentCRUD teacherId={user.id} />`

**Permissions:** Teachers can create, edit, and delete their own content. They can edit student information but cannot delete students (admin only).

#### Student Dashboard (`/src/pages/student/StudentDashboard.tsx`)

**Existing Implementation:**
- Students already have real-time access to:
  - Published assessments
  - Assignments
  - Skills evaluations
  - Attendance records
  - Calendar/schedule

**Permissions:** Students have read-only access. All CRUD components automatically hide action buttons for students.

## Real-Time Synchronization

### How It Works

1. **Subscription Setup:**
   ```typescript
   const channel = supabase
     .channel(`${tableName}-changes`)
     .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: tableName },
       (payload) => {
         // Handle INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events
       }
     )
     .subscribe();
   ```

2. **Event Handling:**
   - `INSERT` → Add new item to local state
   - `UPDATE` → Update matching item in local state
   - `DELETE` → Remove item from local state

3. **Automatic Updates:**
   - Admin creates a new student → Teachers and other admins see it immediately
   - Teacher changes a lesson date → Admin and students see updated schedule instantly
   - Admin updates student score → Student sees new score in real-time

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Admin adds a new student**
1. Admin fills out student form and clicks "Create"
2. Data is inserted into `dashboard_students` table
3. All connected clients (admins, teachers) receive `INSERT` event
4. New student appears in all dashboards without refresh

**Scenario 2: Teacher changes lesson date**
1. Teacher edits lesson in Curriculum tab
2. Data is updated in `curriculum` table
3. Admin dashboard automatically shows new date
4. Student sees updated schedule in their calendar

**Scenario 3: Admin updates assignment score**
1. Admin edits student assessment and publishes it
2. Data is updated in `assessment` table with `published=true`
3. Student dashboard receives `UPDATE` event
4. New score appears immediately in student's assessment list

## Database Schema Integration

### Tables Managed:

1. **teachers** - Teacher profiles and information
2. **dashboard_students** - Student profiles and tracking
3. **curriculum** - Lesson plans with activities and resources
4. **calendar_sessions** - Scheduled class sessions
5. **assignments** - Class and individual assignments
6. **assessment** - Student assessments with rubric scores
7. **skills_evaluation** - Detailed skill tracking

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled with permissive policies for development. In production, you should update policies to:

```sql
-- Example: Students can only view their own data
CREATE POLICY "Students view own data"
  ON assessment FOR SELECT
  USING (student_id = auth.uid() AND published = true);

-- Example: Teachers can manage their own content
CREATE POLICY "Teachers manage own lessons"
  ON curriculum FOR ALL
  USING (teacher_id = auth.uid());

-- Example: Admins have full access
CREATE POLICY "Admins full access"
  ON teachers FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
      AND auth.users.role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

## Usage Guide

### For Admins:

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Select any tab (Students, Teachers, Curriculum, etc.)
3. Click "Add [Entity]" button to create new records
4. Click edit icon to modify existing records
5. Click delete icon to remove records (with confirmation)
6. All changes sync instantly to all users

### For Teachers:

1. Navigate to Teacher Dashboard
2. Use Calendar tab to schedule sessions
3. Use Curriculum tab to create lessons
4. Use Assignments tab to create homework/tasks
5. Use Assessment tab to grade students
6. Use Students tab to view/update student info
7. All changes sync to admin and students in real-time

### For Students:

1. Navigate to Student Dashboard
2. View published assessments and scores
3. See assignments and due dates
4. Track skills progress
5. View attendance and schedule
6. All data updates automatically when teachers/admins make changes

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:

1. **Filtered Queries** - Only fetch relevant data (e.g., teacher's own lessons)
2. **Indexed Columns** - Database indexes on frequently queried columns
3. **Pagination Support** - Large tables can be paginated (ready for implementation)
4. **Automatic Cleanup** - Subscriptions are cleaned up on component unmount
5. **Memoization** - Use of useMemo and useCallback where appropriate

### Best Practices:

- **Limit Real-Time Channels** - Only subscribe to tables actively being viewed
- **Debounce Updates** - For high-frequency updates, consider debouncing
- **Filter Early** - Apply filters at the database level, not in client code
- **Batch Operations** - Use batch inserts/updates for multiple records

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Open admin dashboard in one browser
- [ ] Open teacher dashboard in another browser
- [ ] Create a student as admin
- [ ] Verify student appears in teacher dashboard immediately
- [ ] Edit student info as teacher
- [ ] Verify changes appear in admin dashboard
- [ ] Create a lesson as teacher
- [ ] Verify admin sees the new lesson
- [ ] Update lesson date as admin
- [ ] Verify teacher sees updated date
- [ ] Create and publish assessment
- [ ] Verify student sees published assessment
- [ ] Delete a record as admin
- [ ] Verify deletion reflects everywhere

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Real-time not working:**
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify Supabase realtime is enabled for tables
- Check RLS policies allow subscriptions
- Ensure correct table and column names

**Permission errors:**
- Verify user role in auth context
- Check RLS policies match role requirements
- Ensure user is authenticated

**Data not appearing:**
- Check database has sample data
- Verify filters are not too restrictive
- Check for console errors
- Refresh page to force re-fetch

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Optimistic Updates** - Update UI immediately before server confirms
2. **Offline Support** - Queue changes when offline, sync when online
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle concurrent edits gracefully
4. **Advanced Filtering** - Add search, sort, and filter controls
5. **Bulk Operations** - Select multiple items for bulk actions
6. **Export/Import** - CSV/Excel export and import functionality
7. **Audit Trail** - Track who changed what and when
8. **Notifications** - Push notifications for important updates
9. **Undo/Redo** - Allow users to revert recent changes
10. **Version History** - Track historical changes to records

## Security Recommendations

For production deployment:

1. **Update RLS Policies** - Implement strict row-level security
2. **Validate Input** - Add server-side validation
3. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse of CRUD operations
4. **Audit Logging** - Log all create/update/delete operations
5. **Encryption** - Ensure sensitive data is encrypted
6. **API Security** - Use secure API keys and environment variables
7. **Session Management** - Implement proper session timeout
8. **Two-Factor Auth** - Add 2FA for admin accounts
