## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About File Upload
The file upload functionality is prepared but requires:
1. Storage buckets to be created
2. RLS policies to be configured
3. File upload component to be added (future enhancement)

Currently, resources use URLs. To add file upload:
- Modify ResourceLibrary component
- Add file input and upload to Supabase storage
- Store storage path in resources table

### About Assessment Table
The assessment table was modified to support class-based assessments:
- `student_id` and `student_name` are now optional
- New field: `is_class_assessment` (boolean)
- New field: `assessment_type` (individual, class, group)

The Assessment tab was removed from teacher dashboard as requested, but the table structure is preserved for future use.
