SELECT 'Classes' as item, COUNT(*) as count
FROM classes
WHERE teacher_id = '389ea82c-db4c-40be-aee0-6b39785813da'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Curriculum', COUNT(*)
FROM curriculum
WHERE teacher_id = '389ea82c-db4c-40be-aee0-6b39785813da'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Assignments', COUNT(*)
FROM teacher_assignments
WHERE teacher_id = '389ea82c-db4c-40be-aee0-6b39785813da'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Sessions', COUNT(*)

## ⚠️ Note About Other Migration Error

There was an error with a different migration (`20251118130000_normalize_lessons_schema.sql`), but that's unrelated to Donald's setup.

**Donald's migration was applied successfully!** The error was in a separate migration that tried to run at the same time.

   # NOT: http://127.0.0.1:54321
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear all
   - Refresh page

3. **Check auth user matches:**
   - Login as Donald
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Run: `supabase.auth.getUser()`
   - Verify UUID is: `389ea82c-db4c-40be-aee0-6b39785813da`

4. **Verify in database:**
   - Run verification query in Supabase Dashboard (see above)
